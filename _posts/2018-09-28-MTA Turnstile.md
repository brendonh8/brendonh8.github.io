The New York City subway system is a notoriously busy part of everyone's commute. Living in NYC has given me first hand experience of this. The biggest pressure point of commuting for me is getting stuck going in and out of the station. While it can only be for a couple minutes, those minutes drag on forever as I get sandwiched between people going both directions. This issue is the main focus of this post.

For my teams first project at Metis, our goal was to utilize MTA turnstile data to solve a problem of our choosing. We decided to pose as consultants working with the mobile app Citymapper and see if we could use traffic through turnstiles to direct commuters through less used entrances and exits while still being convenient to their trip.
